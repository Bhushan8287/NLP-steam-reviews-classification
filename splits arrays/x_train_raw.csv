bad endgame enjoyed right zen last area game zen clearly rushed development valve could fine tune like game weak 3rd act recommend play something else
half life source basically described worse version original half life contains funny ragdoll physic game offer little enhancement compared original plagued plethora bug although necessarily game breaking still ruin otherwise amazing game kill scientist solely witness funny ragdoll
best shooter strategy game played liked play two way 1 hide building big gun kill 40 people wondering fuck 2 go somewhere behind building shotgun flank kill go step 1
buy 2 buy 1 becouse needed annoying action
still one best fps game wish still active everything else still call game goat

generally bland repetitive grasp considered great co op survival game played one map played nothing change aside fact sit gameplay different layout leveling perk major grind even workshop map designed still spending hour problem fact perk straight mandatory gameplay enjoyment achievement biggest pain however forced replay map four different difficulty artificial way stretching length game spending anywhere 20 40 minute depending difficulty playthrough roughly two hour per map assuming f ck due bad luck later wave factor worry game ai mostly exploited making whole thing cat mouse game higher difficulty half hour running around map circle idea fun aside find questionable co op survival game punish playing others actually significantly easier play game number enemy spawn rate heavily influenced talking either facing 30 enemy 200 enemy first wave alone basically rewarded learning solo game although difficult still pain reasonable tweak difficulty depend number player game go way overboard put perspective two additional player stretch session one hour
trashhhh

continuation half life 2 really like game level design take noticeable step actually dialogue hit high previous game biggest problem though story simply escape city 17 felt really lazy unimaginative could nitpick giving endgame weapon hl2 start game away take lot impact away getting first time opinion say read summary watch playthrough play episode 2
extremely fast paced game good weapon balance good map design find enjoyable many reason picking enemy grenade throwing back trying never get old ragdoll physic hilariously funny radio system useful super fun use respawn mechanic perfect wait till end round dead like counter strike action fluid yet still wave unlike battlefield think 5v5 really shone nostalgic biased p due weapon variety destined good gungame tdm orange lime map awesome invention though people would say otherwise great addition take crisp game mechanic ditch realism part graphic emphasis fall game mechanic map design basically focuse gunplay compared normal map weapon grenade restriction applied many map though downside weapon grenade pickup button day plus handy option could lifted console cfg actual option menu like hud customization 10 10 would recommend anybody like fast paced multiplayer shooter

half life blue shift brief somewhat enjoyable add original half life albeit caveat perspective would different played dreamcast version standalone game steam find difficult recommend game short length design tailored limitation dreamcast result lack weapon variety compared opposing force underwhelming player become accustomed wider arsenal however important note game inherently bad opportunity encounter gordon familiar character throughout game treat story organized showcased compared previous iteration blue shift merit aspect yet evaluated independent game blue shift fall short polished half life experience come expect value would apparent released add similar dreamcast version without burden price tag original game would easier appreciate positive ultimately standalone game lacking refinement associate half life series find hard justify investing time money blue shift compelling experience within franchise offer richer satisfying gameplay experience

hacking simulation aim realistic trope game already present immersion side game job really well second start game onwards main menu tutorial already game uplink present game real application hack world bonus point afromentioned immersion part following however creative remotely realistic yet horribly dull gameplay experience take mission central server tell delete file x add xyz someone college degree steal someone bank detail mail money elsewhere click button set route go across every server ever found without exception server always better give time 5 procedure different combination lack thereof usually consisting picking program bought clicking target field waiting loading bar finish thing log delete log single public server prevent anyone ever finding cash money buy new program repeat appreciate style game creative vision end feel like mildly complex console gui based fetch quest simulator overall would argue likely one realistic maybe even better hacking sims simply really satisfying enjoyable experience
3 hour game seems one final chapter enemy believe called finally left bunker told renter another door game literally looped guiding back mission begining except elevator end longer work crush try ride therefore cannot recommend game anyone literally work

much sluggish c go literally downgrade
hand one best 4 man co op game great fun friend unfortunate one campaign free play however find community map well although rather pay get map incredibly awesome
fixtf2 either fix game shut valve
esta nazi la dedique matar bot porque la jugaba cuando tenia internet
underrated awesome game also free
l4d went space game ok short thats alien swarm need campaings hey game totally free
good time go
apparently valve ripped half life make game information look gay pornography
isint good 1st game opposing force bit short still fun game
game refuse die
game take great first one make even better four time long also look ton better without much performance impact 1440p 30fps integrated graphic story game also even better first game impressive feat highly recommend
sure whether recommend played right original really fell short game play still hold probably mind blowing time puzzle cool quite single bos battle apparently shooting bazooka aircraft bos fight happens like 10 time game time exactly obviously original outshines real downgrade story character old character decimated especially calhoun blue shift favorite character new one mega annoying option kill alyx whole time feeling hostage terrorist activity cant line protagonist anyhow collaborates alien quite cheap people like guess probably try despite rant game good might like liked original 5 10
23 year later safely say half life blue shift hold well even argue refined half life
classic game unfortunately pretty dead enjoy playing ai sometimes
opposing force as motherfucker keep dying
play return elf instead far superior experience
look massacred boy gameplay quite refined must say
removed community mode lacking map improvement especially hostage mode
major issue present game due branch half life 2 word game official standalone mod half life 2 relies codebase function however half life 2 get updated take care half life source leaving game accumulate bug time borderline unplayable since 2013 thing note list hd content oddly fan made mod fix game completely older build set bug fixed various update released 2013 list fortunately like game made valve extremely cheap sale hesitate try want see like make sure download mod mod db fixed issue enable hd model want explore change made version want enjoy half life forget uplink decay half life source
new map started look like league legend dota reason played keeping old system unique special add like every game dev make bad decision lead shitting game rest peace dota
valve fix ur anticheat dossing issue christ sake rely third party server play game
get rid bot valve
good game however cannot recommend every server usually empty whenever people playing usually 1 3 people server pretty much paying 3 99 dead game singleplayer

tras haber jugado 1 500 horas counter strike se hace imposible poder tener un momento de disfrute en el al tener un deseo latente de escalar entre los rangos llego percibir que tenga progreso como jugador ni equipo toda la partidas pienso cual e el punto de estar en esto al tener paciencia equipos siempre son 50 50 pero al pasar tanta repeticion perder perder ya puedo soportar seguir pienso en ganar pero llegar los resultados e agotador ma que una fatiga mental pido ma de estejuego ya que yo soy el problema mi deseo de victoria supera mi experiencia competitiva fue fenomenal siempre con debilidades fortalezas derrota tras victoria e bastante dificil pensar en un juego que alla pasado tanto tiempo viviendo mi mejor adolecencia quiero ir al pasado pese todo ma bien gustaria haber explotado mi habilidades haber alcanzado ma ma quien sabe ser profesional pero parace que pudo ser odio tristeza estan en mi mente querer ser ma de lo que uno e e malo supongo

counter strike tuah
cxzc
light low purchase price worth play despite historical setting definitely attempting realistic historic performance availability use weapon heavily adjusted play balance rather realism example although real m1 garand mauser 98k would similar performance term ability wound kill single shot game 98k made quite easy score one shot kill garand seems typically require two shot offset rate fire every rifleman also seems grenadier rifle grenade launcher odd reason without hand grenade deprives german rifleman signature potato masher grenade pistol far common odd reason seem damage per shot smgs exactly opposite reality bar frequently used heavy assault rifle lmg properly stg 44 hand given extra recoil order make kind german bar fact completely wrong first assault rifle combine lethality rifle like mauser garand low recoil smg like thompson mp 40 really easy use incredibly deadly also incredibly rare g 43 k 43 semi automatic rifle german fielded completely missing bazooka panzerschreck would far valuable waste infantry target used primarily anti personnell weapon word realism look sale 2 ok buy

amazing game
way many hacker nothing actually stopping 1000 hacker 1 get banned percentage huge actually affecting experience game
compared today basic class based fps shooter requires twitch reflex c source modded derivative c different coat paint today spoiled built game progression bigger map grindable attachment like camo sight type fps player care choose focus improving skill game lived died balanced mechanic muscle memory also fps player focus less grind objective built achievement game maybe crossover lead question whether lively community game nostalgic fall first category fps player anyways core mechanic map community game perfect trifecta keep life valve game sale give hour fun maybe enjoy classic fps genre

half life blue shift una espansione del famoso gioco half life il gioco ci fa vivere la storia di half life da un altro punto di vista cio metterci nei panni di un agente di sicurezza barney calhoun di black mesa giocare con un altro protagonista interessante peccato che il gioco dura 3 4 ore rispetto al classico half life che durava ben 15 ore inoltre non ci sono miglioramenti tecnici comunque aggiunte armi nemici ecc ecc comunque un dlc carino da giocare grazie anche al suo prezzo ridotto di solo 3 99 euro

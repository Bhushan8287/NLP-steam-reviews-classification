flooded cheating bot game current state unplayable
short sweet expansion pack interesting add little content wise compared opposing force even original half life make sense consider original purpose part half life port dreamcast similarly decay part ps2 port inevitably never came due dreamcast poor sale led released game despite still suggest playing blue shift want little extra half life content expect blown away like game franchise

puginen paska vaikka kiva pelata
vividly remember playing countless hour dod kid probably played even c 1 4 1 6 even oldschool counter strike lost touch day defeat seems aged well map feel small gameplay especially weapon handling feel outdated able get like even nostalgia bonus could muster therefore believe day defeat deserve venerable place hall fame little reason buy play today standard get historical reason nostalgia never played heard great well great probably neither feel way fully understand many people played like crazy therefore general public cannot recommend anymore
half life blue shift fun exspansion half life also kinda underwhelming compared last one opposing force pro playing event original game security guard pretty neat idea fun getting another chance explore black mesa resonance cascade overall level design still pretty good say ever got lost comfused much platforming time con unlike opposing force exspansion dosen implement new idea new alien weapon think campain little longer fan hd weapon pack look odd there option classic weapon yeah whole lot say since less previous game less liked half life opposing force probably enjoy recomend game either pack sale mostly due short short simple still fun
